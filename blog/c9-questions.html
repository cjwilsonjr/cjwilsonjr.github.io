      <h1>Questioning Questioning</h1>
      <h3>What is a Good Question?</h3>
      <h4>March 11, 2015</h4>
  </div>

    <p>
      Throughout my childhood I was always encouraged to ask plenty of questions, comforted by the often-repeated phrase "there's no such thing as a stupid question."  While useful as a teaching tool for children, the phrase is incomplete.  The revised phrase should include a caveat about the clarity of the question.  Maybe something like "there's no such thing as a stupid question, but not all questions have utility due to lack of clarity" would suffice.  Oh it's not very catchy, you say?  Well then just remember this next time you ask a question: always ask but make sure your grandma could understand what you're asking if you want a helpful answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good question includes a brief yet engaging backstory, specific code, and a specific goal.  I've found that while coding I receive the best answers when I first fully think through the question I want to ask so I will receive the conclusion I actually want.  A garbled mess of half-thought words can confuse anyone, even with specific code to view.  In which language are you writing your code?  What isn't happening that you think should be?  Have you tried to research this issue already?  I want to provide specific information pertaining to the code, but I don't want to bog down the reader with an essay.  On the other hand there's no use in asking a question if the reader must ask for more information or clarification.
    </p>
      <p>
        Including code in your question is undoubtedly useful, but too much can be just as unhelpful as not enough.  Nobody wants information overload--only provide snippets of code that pertain to the specific question, not the entire file of code.  When I'm coding I like to refer specifically to line numbers as a way to frame the code for the reader.
      </p>
    <p>
      Finally proofread your question before submitting it!  A good rule of thumb is to read through it and imagine that you are somebody else reading the question.  If you were trying to answer the question, would you have enough information from the post to do so?  Did you ask a specific question about a specific piece of code?  If not, it's necessary to clarify before submitting the post.  Don't waste your time writing a question that nobody will be able to answer.  To receive a concise, clear, and specific answer, you must write a concise, clear, and specific question.
