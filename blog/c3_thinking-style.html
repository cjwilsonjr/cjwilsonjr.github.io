      According to a Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, my personal thinking style is Abstract Sequential.  This basically means that my strengths are visualizing and developing ideas abstractly while organizing information in a linear manner in my head.  You can learn a little bit more about other thinking styles <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">here</a> or take <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this test</a> to discover your own style.  Obviously this isn't the only method of thinking I use.  Everyone has a pretty varied amalgamation of traits, and I'm no different.  My test scores were rather clustered near the center of the "thinking specturm."  But I definitely exhibit thinking tendencies that fall under my main category.  True to my thinking style's attributes, I love taking my time when evaluating an overarching idea or opportunity, sometimes alone.  Additionally abstract sequential learners learn best with access to experts and references.  But how can I use this knowledge to help me learn at Dev Bootcamp?  Unfortunately taking my time, especially by myself, often leads to overthinking. This could potentially cause problems if I have time constraints or teammates used to working at a different pace.  Making a gut decision, taking note of my decision for later reference, and listening to my teammates are good strategies to overcome this pitfall.  It's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't love access to real-life experts.  Dev Bootcamp has top-notch experts champing at the bit to answer my questions and guide me towards success.  I must ask for help when I'm lost in order to propser at DBC.  Thank goodness I've sorted that out.  Now I can focus on what I don't know how to do well and improve those aspects of my thought process.

      Commiting to Dev Bootcamp is by no means a riskless endeavor, but I already know that I made the right decision to accept the challenge.  Every morning I've been excited to bury myself in the weekly challenges.  Hours fly by while learning this new material, and my personal mental test validates it all as time well spent.  I've faced some difficulties, but so far the reward has been worth the struggle.  One challenge I've faced happens during pair programming.  Sometimes an idea can leave me as quickly as it came, so I like to type everything down as soon as it pops into my head.  It's a knee-jerk reaction to blurt out my ideas, but my teammates may perceive this action as selfish and commanding.  I like to receive instantaneous feedback that experimenting allows, but I have to respect the roles of pair programming.  Slowing down and typing out a quick note instead of full-on experimentation then presenting my idea at a tactful juncture will help me hit the sweet spot.  Another challenge I've faced is getting flustered when I'm unable to figure out a challenge or contribute meaningfully to a pair programming effort.  I'm not fluent or even conversational in Ruby, so why would I expect myself to be able to figure out every challenge thrown my way without resources?  I have to temper my expectations and be realistic about my current abilities.

      A pure growth mindest is the pinnacle of higher thinking.  "Fixed mindset" almost seems like a dirty, derogatory phrase.  I don't want to be associated with anything fixed--I'll never get better without accepting and exploring new ideas constantly.  I admire Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger for one of their core tenets--constant learning through reading.  Their ability to take ideas from all fields and apply them to any situation, investing or otherwise is nothing short of astounding and certainly admirable.  Imagine using engineering and philosophy principles to evaluate a business acquisition and try to convince me that broad knowledge isn't useful.  I subscribe 100% to the idea that constant learning is power, and books are the gateway into others' minds.  Why would anyone want to deny themselves the awesome opportunity to pick somebody's brain for inspiration from the comfort of an arm chair?
