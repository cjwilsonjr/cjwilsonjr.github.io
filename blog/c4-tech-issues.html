      <h1>Net Neutrality</h1>
      <h3>Support Freedom of Access</h3>
      <h4>February 4, 2015</h4>
  </div>
    <p>
    Net Neutrality is such an increasingly prevalent issue in the tech industry that even President Obama has weighed in on it.  Proponents of Net Neutrality argue that internet providers cannot discriminate between customers.  Service providers argue that creating channels of varying speeds helps manage the ever-increasing traffic of users; this could potentially lead to abuse of their controlling positions.  It logically follows that the boom of internet-inspired progress will be stunted by a practice of placing a barrier between customers who aren't willing to pay more and full access to the net.  Slow, inadequate service will be the main dish served to these unwilling users.  This may sound like regular ol' capitalism at its best, but entrepreneurs relying on the internet have been so successful because of the founding principle of freedom of access.  Preserving an atmosphere of instant, fair access to the internet is more important than creating additional revenue streams for prominent internet providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federal Communcations Commission wants to resolve this issue by making the internet a utility, which it would then be able to regulate with its own neutrality rules.  This response seems unlikely to happen because of the constant legal battles because the internet is currently regarded as an "unregulated information service."
      In truth the market should be able to take care of the issue itself.  According to an article in The Economist, we should "encourage vigorous competition in all parts of the internet, particularly between broadband providers, so that none can become a bottleneck and exploit that position."  An astounding 75% of Americans households have no choice of provider to access faster internet, so this clearly isn't happening.  But like all commodity businesses without an extensive competitive advantage, the most efficient and lowest-cost company can compete and undercut current prices.  This should eventually force other businesses to follow suit with lower prices.  In lieu of a massive overhaul of the business like this, the FCC should be able to regulate what the current internet providers do with broad rules regulating differences in speed for customers.  If the telecom companies may in fact provide different speeds to different customers, the FCC should step in as a regulatory body to safeguard against vast discrepancies in service.  This week the FCC will release a new proposal for overarching Net Neutrality rules to hopefully help end this debate.</p>
      <p>February 5 Update: Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, released a statement on Wednesday that bans the blocking, slowing down, or speeding up of website for payment.  These restrictions apply to fixed and wireless broadband.  Additionally the FCC would not use its authority to regulate broadband prices.  This proposal is more in line with treating the internet as a utility to be regulated, but it doesn't go as far as setting specific price targets for broadband providers.  This is a victory for open-internet proponents.
