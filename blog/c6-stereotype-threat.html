      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h3>Can I Make an Impact?</h3>
      <h4>February 19, 2015</h4>
  </div>
     <p>
    Stereotype threat refers to the threat of acting in a way that confirms a stereotype or being seen as a representation of negative stereotype or a member of a group that perpetuates a negative stereotype.  This social insight has been largely researched and popularized by social psychologist Claude M. Steele.  He asserts that stereotype threat can adversely affect an individuals' performance based on their situational social identities.  For more information on the specifics of this subject, check out <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html">this excellent article</a>.  This post will explore my experience with stereotype threat in the workplace and how I was able to alleviate it to a degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2012 I was a recent college graduate still trying to get my feet wet in the real world.  After months of searching I finally landed a job as a co-manager (assistant store manager) for a grocery chain.  I eagerly pounced on the opportunity, and I was excited to learn that there was an intensive 18 week training process before actually stepping onto the floor as a real manager.  I had been in leadership roles before but on a much smaller scale, and I had never worked at this chain before, so I knew this would be new for me.  I justified away any concerns I had as fledgling fear that the training program would squash.  I couldn't have been more wrong.
    </p>
      <p>
      Prior to the training program, I believed I would be ready to make an impact right away.  However as soon as the training wheels came off, I suffered from a serious case of imposter syndrome.  I felt judged by clerks for shooting "straight to the top" even though I had never held a lower position in the company before.  My store manager was the only person who really referenced my greenness, and it was always in a supportive context, but my psyche felt under attack when left unchecked.  Could I really be viewed as an authority figure?  Could I find a balance between competent management and likeability?  For weeks every time a clerk or department manager asked me for advice or to pull a specific report, I unnecessarily worried that I wouldn't provide the right answer.  Discipline was easily the most viscerally uncomfortable area of my new position.  How could I possibly discipline someone who has been with the company for so long, when I likely don't know how "things really work" in the company.  All these feelings were difficult to manage for quite a while.
    </p>
      <p>
      There are ways to somewhat reverse the negative effects of stereotype threat.  As an outsider in a new environment, every comment to or about me seemed like a critique; I felt vulnerable.  In my case I embraced my position as a fledgling and accepted it as a part of my identity instead of repelling it.  I started to be up front with my direct reports about how I felt and wasn't afraid to admit when I didn't know.  I took it upon myself to reduce these threats.  My solution was to force myself to examine my environment and what continually made me feel uncomfortable.  Companies can spread awareness of stereotype threat easily from a top down perspective; when we accept the existence threat, we are empowered to conquer it.
