      <h1>Personal Values and Stereotype Threats</h1>
      <h3>A Threat Worth Combating</h3>
      <h4>February 26, 2015</h4>
  </div>
      <p>
      For this post I was given a list of values, and I chose values that were meaningful to me with a number ranking based on how I try to live up to the values.  I chose:
      <ul><li>adventure: 3</li>
      <li>close relationships: 4</li>
      <li>freedom: 5</li>
      <li>health: 5</li>
      <li>personal development: 4</li>
      <li>music: 4</li>
      <li>tranquility: 4</li>
      <li>wisdom: 4</ul>

      It's very possible that I'm biased towards my number ratings, but then again I wouldn't choose these values if they weren't important to me.  Health, both mental and physical, is one of the more important values in my life.  In reality healthy living is so much easier to maintain if healthy habits are established early, and these habits will help keep you at the top of your game for as long as possible.  Warren Buffett provides an outstanding lesson that sums up my feelings on the subject:
    </p>
      <p><b>
      "Let's say that when I turned sixteen, a genie had appeared to me. And that genie said, 'Warren, I'm going to give you the car of your choice. It'll be here tomorrow morning with a big bow tied on it. Brand-new. And it's all yours.'
      Having heard all the genie stories, I would say, 'What's the catch?' And the genie would answer, 'There's only one catch. This is the last car you're ever going to ge tin your life. So it's got to last a lifetime.'
      If that had happened, I would have picked out that car. But, can you imagine, knowing it had to last a lifetime, what I would do with it?
      I would read the manual about five times. I would always keep it garaged. If there was the least little dent or scratch, I'd have it fixed right away because I wouldn't want it rusting. I would baby that car, because it would have to last a lifetime.

      That's exactly the position you are in concerning your mind and body. You only get one mind and one body. And it's got to last a lifetime. Now, it's very easy to let them ride for many years. But if you don't take care of that mind and that body, they'll be a wreck forty years later, just life the car would be.
      It's what you do right now, today, that determines how your mind and body will operate ten, twenty, and thirty years from now.‚Äù"

      I apologize for the lengthy quote, but I love Warren Buffett's wisdom, and a summary of his thoughts just wouldn't do him justice.  I'm so fortunate that my sister taught me about the virtues of healthly living; without her guidance I don't know if I'd have changed my unhealthy college habits as deeply as I did.

      The last time someone asked my advice was actually this past weekend.  My friend's little brother was sharing his app ideas and wanted my opinion on the scope of his idea.  I really appreciated that he both felt close enough to share his ideas with me and thought that I would have some valuable input for him.
    </p>

      My selected list of values is not an all-encompassing picture of my personal belief system, but even these selected few can help me face stereotype threat.  I want to share these values with others because I know how helpful they are to personal and relationship development.  Recognizing my values is a key measure of defense for combating stereotype threat.  I know how I view the world, and I know what I want from my life.  With my ideals in mind, I should be able to fend off creeping thoughts caused by stereotype threat.  Also mindful meditation can help my mind from reacting severely to threats because of an actual physical reduction in irrational brain activity.
