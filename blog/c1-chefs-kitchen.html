      In my view Dev Bootcamp provides a top-notch environment for learning because of the program's emphasis on more than just learning code.  In fact the instructors pride themselves on teaching students how to be world-class learners moreso than proficient coders.  I completely agree with this approach; I'd rather have a foundation of engineering sympathies and tools first before a mastery of a specific language because I'll be more adept at learning new languages on my own.  The foundational, empathetic work at Dev Bootcamp is irreplaceable in any field.  The mind doesn't operate well when it doesn't have a healthy body to live in, and it's fantastic that Dev Bootcamp strives to sharpen both during the program.  The culture is perfect for cultivating learning at a high level.

        I'm excited to participate in an environment that encourages a "grab the bull by the horns" mentality.  It is MY nine weeks, and I'm going to put in as much effort as I can during these weeks.  Shereef's "kitchen mentality" seems to be the only way to handle such an intense learning environment.  The onus for learning must be grasped first and foremost by the students.  We are all in this struggle together, so we need to hold ourselves as well as others accountable for learning and succeeding.  I'm also really looking forward to the team environment--struggling with others is a great way to build relationships and knowledge.

        Shereef made a fantastic point that has helped me somewhat calm my apprehension about being a complete beginner: regardless of how much technical knowledge other boots may have coming into the program, we all basically know very little in the wide world of computer programming.  The instructors are aware of our fledgling knowledge and know how to foster growth and motivation.  Additionally the phase system is a fair way to help students who need additional time on the subject matter.  I am nervously awaiting how I'll respond to the intense workload.  Working above and beyond the curriculum during Phase 0 should help prepare me for  more extreme environment.  I've only completed week one of Phase 0, but I'm ecstatic to continue down this new path.  Thank you, DBC!
