      <h1>Social Conflict</h1>
      <h3>Bars are a Drag</h3>
      <h4>March 5, 2015</h4>
  </div>
      <p>
    The following conflict is trivial in the overall scheme of life, but it's a good one to analyze because it occurs often.  I'm not one to stay out late and party in my precious free time, but I face the same social pressure to go out to a bar nearly every weekend.  Last weekend my friends wanted to go to a bar that I deemed crummy the previous time I went there, and I wrestled with the decision to go a second time.  On the one hand my friends would be there, but I really didn't want to go to the physical place they wanted to hang out.  The bar scene plays a socially constructive role every once in a while, but I don't need that role every weekend to lead a fulfilling lifestyle.
    </p>
      <p>
        Now up to this point my issue seems commonplace and probably a bit whiny.  But if I can analyze my thought process, hopefully it will become easier to make decisions of this nature in the future.  My friends know that I don't drink much, so naturally a bar isn't my favorite place to go for fun, and I'm extremely ok with my decisions. Therefore any comments about my personal habits don't really affect me because I'm pretty confident I'm making the right choice for me.  The conflict arises from an inner struggle.  It makes me feel like a bad friend because I don't want to go to a bar.  The issue isn't that I don't want to hang out with them; I truly do, but it would be a lot more fruitful for me to have dinner or just hang out at one of our homes.  I feel selfish because I want to spend time my way and sometimes shut down when forced to do something I'm not excited about.  I become frustrated because I think we all could be spending our time on more worthy tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's probaly tiresome for my friends, but I like to discuss my feelings about the situation with them.  It makes me feel more at ease after discussing my ideas, and I every time I realize afterwards that seeing my friends is more important than worrying about where we are physically.  I have to enter the situation with that in mind every time in order to resolve this incessant conflict.  I don't want to sacrifice relationships with friends just because I don't want to go somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway I ended up going to the bar, and I was thankful that I got to spend time with my friends.  The only mistake I made was not driving there myself; we got stuck there in a nasty bout of snow, and we could have easily avoided it by leaving a little earlier.  Fostering relationships with friends can happen anywhere, and even if I'm not where I want to be, I can focus on the good in the situation and take advantage of the time spent.
