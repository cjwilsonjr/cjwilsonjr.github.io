      <h1>Ruby Variable Scope</h1>
      <h3>Global, Local, Instance, Class, and Constant</h3>
      <h4>February 19, 2015</h4>
  </div>
      <p>
    Scope refers to how accessible variables and constants are within a program.  Ruby has four variable scope options <b>(global, local, instance, and class)</b> and a constant variable choice<b>(constant)</b>.  Each starts with a specific character to help visually identify the type.  Scope is a necessary concept that helps code interpret the priorities and importance of the code.  This is a foundational concept of object-oriented programming.  In this post I will refer to a class Circle that will allow us to calculate the circumference and area of a given circle.  I hope that this example will help outline the basics of variable scope.  Here we go!
      <pre>
        <code>
class Circle
  def initialize(radius)
    @radius=radius
    @pi=Math::PI
  end

  def circumference
    2 * (@pi) * @radius
  end

  def area
    (@pi * @radius) ** 2
  end
end
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Global scope</b> covers the entire program, and <b>global variables</b> act pretty much as you would expect based on their name--they are available everywhere!  They are denoted by a <b>$</b> sign before the variable name.  These are tricky to deal with and sometimes dangerous.  It's tempting to assign values to many global variables to make the value easy to access anywhere within the program.  However there's a definite downside to using them; global variables might be used to replace solid program design based on calling objects, and this goes against the grain of proper object-oriented program design.  A program actually becomes better when each class or method trusts that another object will operate properly even if it doesn't know exactly what it will do or what information it contains.  This is proper design, and widespread global variable use makes that a difficult goal to achieve.
    <p>
      We can think of <b>local variables</b> as the simplest form of variable.  A local variable can only be accessed within the specific code chunk you are writing.  They are identifiable by <b>a starting character of a lowercase letter or underscore(_)</b>.  Below I have taken the methods from class Circle and added to each a local variable called x.
      <pre>
        <code>
  def circumference
    2 * (@pi) * @radius
    x = puts @radius   #if @radius=4, x=4
  end

  def area
    (@pi * @radius) ** 2
    x = puts @radius * 2    #if @radius=4, x=8
  end
        </code>
      </pre>
    As you can see the variable names are the same, but they both represent different values.  With a radius of 4, x in circumference = 4, and x in area = 8.  Because each are in separate methods, the same local variable name may be reused without conflict.  If I create a new method and try to return x in another method, my program won't know what to do if x isn't defined within that method.  There are variables, however, that all users to access the same variable within different methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      I covered <b>instance variables</b> briefly in my last post.  An instance variable is one accessible by any method within a specific instance of a class.  It is denoted by an <b>@</b> before the name.  In the case of my Circle method, by assigning @radius to the variable radius in the initialize method, I'm telling my code to allow other methods within this instance to assign the same value to @radius.  Within a specific instance of Circle, @radius will be the same throughout the class.
      <b>Class variables</b> are similar to instance variables and are denoted by an <b>@@</b> before the variable name.  The main difference is that class variables assign the same value across all instances of the class.  Everytime I create a new instance of the Circle class (Circle.new), the class variable would be the same for each.
      <pre>
        <code>
class Circle

  @@math= 1 + 1

  def initialize(radius)
    @radius=radius
    @pi=Math::PI
  end
end
        </code>
        </pre>
As a rudimentary example, @@math will equal 2 throughout every instance of the Circle class.  This would be helpful if you have to receive and store the same information for each new class.  Instance variables are more common than class variables and preferred for most tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Constants</b> are defined with a specific value and shouldn't be changed once the (Ruby will actually allow you to change a constant, but it is ill-advised).  <b>A constant conventionally is typed in all capital letters.</b>  The constant has a global scope when defined outside of a class but is accessible within any instance of a class when defined inside a class.  In the Circle class PI is actually an example of a constant variable of the Math module.  PI always contains the float equivalent of 3.141592... .  I want to reiterate that constant values are accessible within the class or module it was created.  If you are outside of the class or module, you use the :: operator to access the value like we did with Math::PI.  Because we know the path, we can access the constant.
