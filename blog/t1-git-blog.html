      <h3>Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h3>

Think of version control as a save point in a video game.  Instead of saving every single character you type, version control saves a bundle of changes through a method called a 'commit.'  Version control makes tracking any type of change organized and provides a checkpoint to return to if your new changes have seriously unintended effects.  It becomes especially useful during a team project; teammates can work on the same files simultaneously and merge all the changes together after each separte edit has been made.  It is a basic yet vital concept for efficient coding.  Version control can save your sanity, and it's a crucial skill to master to become an effective teammate.    </p>
    <p>
Git is a popular version control system that allows users to make changes to code.  Git is a local system, so it stays on your personal computer.  You can copy code from a public source and pull it to your computer to edit without changing the original code right away.  Git allows users to create different versions of code called branches.  These branches can be manipulated and saved with the "git commit" command.  Once you're satisfied with the work you've done in a specific branch, you can save these changes and push the changes back to the live version of the code and delete the remaining branches that you will not use.    </p>
    <p>
You may be wondering where you'll be pushing this code to make it live on the web.  Users export code edited in the local system Git to a public website called GitHub.  GitHub is a social-coding website that allows users to share code and track changes made to that code.  Because GitHub is open source (code may be used and changed by anyone), projects can be improved by anyone willing to work on it.  GitHub encourages collaboration and accountability while editing code because many times you'll be editing somebody else's code.  If you are a part of a team working on the same code at the local level, GitHub can collect the changes from each person and systematically incorporate the changes into one big file.    </p>
