      <h1>Pair Programming and Feedback</h1>
      <h3>Two Peas in a Pod</h3>
      <h4>February 13, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Before beginning Dev Bootcamp, I recognized that the program's emphasis on peer programming would benefit me as a programmer in the future.  Regardless of this acknowledgement, I was still very intimidated by the idea.  I remember before my first pairing session I was anxious to see how badly my meager skills paled in comparison to my pair.  I know nothing, so how am I going to succeed?  Take that anxiety and double it for an estimate of how I felt before my first guided pairing session.  Not only might I embarass myself in front of my pair--now I had to worry about impressing my guide as well!  Obviously that's a foolish thought because we are all beginners, but I couldn't help but feel inadequate.  I researched "imposter syndrome" and realized that my feeling was actually common.  It dawned on me that many of my peers may feel exactly the same way.  From that point on I started to approach my sessions with less apprehension and more eagerness.  I stopped worrying about what my peer thought of me and began to embrace the experience as a chance to soak up as much knowledge as I could.  I now realize the full potential of collaborating with someone else on a challenge.  Most of my pair programming sessions since have been filled with learning and teaching moments.  Typically one person is teaching the other something new, and when each pair is stuck during a challenge, it's just another opportunity to strengthen your patience and researching abilities.  When my pair implements some brilliant code, I literally cheer aloud for them.  Especially as a beginner everything is an pretty big accomplishment.  I get genuinely excited about another's progress, and I think it helps maintain a good atmosphere during the session.  Pairing now makes challenges a little more approachable and fun because I can bounce ideas off of someone and pick my pair's brain for new information.

      Feedback is high encouraged at Dev Bootcamp, but it must be specific, actionable, and kind (as in truthful, not necessarily nice).  Every week we rate our peers' feedback and write our own for the pairing sessions we've completed.  I look forward to reading my feedback every week; constructive criticism is crucial to a positive learning experience.  Truthfully how will I ever know about my areas for improvement if nobody ever tells me about them?  It's more useful for an outsider to observe my behavior and point out weak spots than to rely soley on introverted self-examinations that may likely be biased.  Fortunately most of the feedback I've received has been very useful.  So far I've learned that my strengths are  My biggest area for improvement is sharing what's on my mind and not being shy about having an idea.  I can't be afraid to stop my partner and ask for clarification if they are operating on a level above mine.  Speaking through every step of my logic is still a very new procedure for me, and I don't want to annoy my pair by reiterating thoughts that they may understand well.  I'm going to alert my pairs to this deficiency and ask them to be on the lookout for it during our sessions.  My experience writing feedback has been mixed so far.  I like to reference specific instances from our code to provide specific examples of success, but I struggle to find very constructive thoughts to share as far as improvements for next time.  I've gotten along so well with my pairs up to this point that I'm hard-pressed to point out flaws.  I've been trained throughout my life to tread lightly and not hurt any feelings during feedback, so even the slightest critique feels like I'm giving a scathing review.  Simply put I just have to get over this because in all likelihood they appreciate the honest feedback as much as I do.

    Pair programming and feedback go hand-in-hand when it comes to growing as a student of any subject.  You won't get very far if you aren't constantly trying to improve yourself.  Both technically and culturally I still have a long way to go before I even become a successful novice, but working with other students and learning what they honestly felt during our pair sessions is an irreplaceable asset for growth.
