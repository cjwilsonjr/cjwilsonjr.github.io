  <!-- Add your reflection here. -->
  <!--This GPS session was a lot more fruitful than my first.  Fortunately I felt more confident afterwards instead of less.  I loved being asked questions often by my guide because it gave me the opportunity to show what I knew and expose what I didn't know.  This challenge helped cement my understanding of the difference between divs(universal) and sections(text heavy doc) in HTML as well as when to use ids (unique one time) vs classes(repeated style).  Also in CSS we experimented with inline, inline-block, and block display as well as absolute and relative positioning.  It will take much practice to make a website look professional, but updating my site weekly will help refresh these ideas and hopefully introduce new info through research.  I found the wireframing exercise more helpful when collaborating with someone--it's really a smart idea.  I want to make sure everyone is on the same page while programming our vision.-->
